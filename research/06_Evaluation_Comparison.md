# Evaluation & Comparison

<div align="justify">

This section evaluates the two incentive models implemented in BEneFIT — **Lock-and-Release** and **Redistribution** — and compares them with leading Move-to-Earn (M2E) applications such as **StepN** and **Sweatcoin**.

## 1. Internal Model Comparison (BEneFIT)

| Aspect                       | Lock-and-Release                            | Redistribution Model                             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Competition Style**       | Solo-based                                  | Group-based                                      |
| **Stake Outcome**           | Returned on goal success                    | Lost if goal fails, redistributed to others      |
| **Validation Type**         | API + optional ML                           | API + Peer Voting + optional ML                  |
| **Privacy Level**           | High (wallet-only)                          | Medium (goal/data visible to peers)              |
| **Trust Mechanism**         | Fully automated smart contract logic        | Trustless + social validation                    |
| **Fraud Resistance**        | OAuth + backend ML                          | OAuth + ML + peer validation                     |
| **Gas Cost**                | Low                                         | Medium to High                                   |
| **Scalability**             | High (no validators needed)                 | Medium (depends on active validator pool)        |
| **Ideal User Type**         | Individuals seeking private accountability  | Competitive users motivated by group validation  |

## 4. Observations

- **Sweatcoin** lacks tradeable rewards and operates entirely within a centralized ecosystem.
- **StepN** introduces crypto tokens and NFTs but has significant onboarding friction and token inflation issues.
- **BEneFIT** bridges the gap by offering:
  - Real monetary value (ETH),
  - Full decentralization with transparent smart contracts,
  - Customizable goals,
  - Robust fraud protection.
