## 🧠 4. Beyond the Metrics — Why BEneFIT Is Different

While StepN and Sweatcoin offer token-based rewards, they lack **true user accountability**:

- **Sweatcoin** gives coupons or points — nice, but ignorable.
- **StepN** gives tokens, but value is volatile and motivation can fade.

**BEneFIT flips the model**:

> 🎯 You stake **your own ETH** and only get it back if you meet your fitness goal.

- If you **succeed**, you're **rewarded** from the pool.
- If you **fail**, your stake is **redistributed** to successful users.
- Verified via **on-chain oracles** — no need to trust a company.

It’s not gamification — it’s **financial commitment as motivation**.

## 💡 Final Verdict: Why BEneFIT Wins

**StepN** is efficient and widely used.  
**Sweatcoin** is richer in logic but costlier to run.  
**BEneFIT** introduces a stronger behavioral model:

- 🔐 Stake your own ETH
- 🏃‍♂️ Validate goals via oracles
- 🎁 Win or lose crypto based on real commitment
