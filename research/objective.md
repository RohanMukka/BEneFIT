## Objective

<div align="justify">

The objective of this project is to develop <strong>BEneFIT</strong>, a prototype decentralized
fitness accountability application that combines behavioral psychology with smart contract
automation to motivate users toward personal health goals. By leveraging Web3 technologies,
BEneFIT enables users to anonymously submit their fitness goals and contribute ETH to a
shared accountability pool. Once all goals are mutually approved, the pool is locked and a
smart contract monitors weekly or monthly progress using mobile fitness tracking data
(e.g., Apple Health, Google Fit).

To address concerns about trust, verification, and decentralization, our system supports:

- <strong>Anonymous identity</strong> for goal submissions  
- <strong>Group-based approval mechanisms</strong>  
- <strong>Tamper-resistant fitness verification</strong> using fitness APIs  
- <strong>Fair redistribution</strong> of forfeited stakes only to successful participants  

This project also investigates <strong>zero-knowledge voting</strong> and <strong>decentralized validation techniques</strong>
to reduce reliance on central coordinators and prevent spoofing.

The ultimate goal is to create a <strong>resilient, inclusive, and transparent system</strong> for fitness motivation
that improves upon current platforms like Sweatcoin and Stepn by offering:

- <strong>Customizable goals</strong>  
- <strong>No dependency on NFTs</strong>  
- <strong>Fair, non-inflationary incentives</strong>
