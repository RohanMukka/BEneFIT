# Conclusion

<div align="justify">

The BEneFIT framework introduces a novel approach to fitness accountability by combining behavioral psychology with decentralized smart contract logic. Unlike existing Move-to-Earn platforms that rely on centralized control, gamified tokens, or expensive NFTs, BEneFIT provides two transparent and trustless models — **Lock-and-Release** and **Redistribution** — to serve different user motivations.

By staking real ETH, users commit to personal fitness goals with meaningful consequences. The Lock-and-Release model supports private, non-competitive goal-setting, while the Redistribution model encourages group accountability and shared success. Both models utilize verified health data from Google Fit or Apple Health, and optionally apply ML-based fraud detection to ensure fairness.

In contrast to apps like Sweatcoin and StepN, BEneFIT empowers users with greater flexibility, security, and ownership over their data and incentives. It sets a new standard for decentralized wellness platforms — one where goals are self-directed, data integrity is preserved, and rewards are both fair and non-inflationary.
