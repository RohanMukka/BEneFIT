# Future Work

<div align="justify">

While BEneFIT establishes a strong foundation for decentralized fitness motivation, several enhancements can improve security, scalability, and user experience:

---

## 🛡️ 1. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
Implement ZKPs to allow users to prove they met a fitness goal **without revealing raw data**, enhancing both privacy and verifiability.

## 🔗 2. Chainlink Oracles
Use Chainlink Functions to fetch verified fitness data directly from APIs (Google Fit, Apple Health), removing the need for centralized backend validation.

## ⭐ 3. Validator Reputation System
Introduce a reputation score or slashing mechanism for validators in the Redistribution model to discourage dishonest voting or inactivity.

## 📱 4. Full Mobile App Integration
Develop a cross-platform mobile application that connects directly to health APIs and allows seamless staking, goal submission, and progress tracking.

## 🧩 5. Group Challenges and Collaborative Pools
Enable team-based fitness challenges with shared stakes and collaborative goals, encouraging social participation and healthy competition.

## 🧠 6. On-Chain Fraud Detection (Future Research)
Explore the feasibility of compiling ML-based fraud detection models (e.g., CNNs) into on-chain verifiable computations using zkML or WASM-based oracle systems.

## 🌐 7. Layer 2 Deployment
To reduce gas fees and improve UX, consider deploying on Ethereum Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, or zkSync.

These enhancements will further strengthen BEneFIT’s mission to build a decentralized, privacy-respecting, and behaviorally effective fitness ecosystem.
