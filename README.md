### 2. Start the Smart Contract Server
Go to the `server/` folder and run:
```bash
cd server
npx hardhat node
```
- This will start a local blockchain at [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545)

## ðŸš€ Deploy Smart Contracts Locally

In a new terminal window (after starting the Hardhat node), go to the `server/` folder and run:
```bash
cd server
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
- This will deploy your smart contracts to the local blockchain.
- After deployment, copy the contract address to connect your frontend with the deployed contract.
